# SACHE: Stable Adaptive Cluster Head Election in Dynamic Sensor Networks

This paper presents SACHE (Stable Adaptive Cluster Head Election), a robust protocol designed to address key limitations of traditional cluster head (CH) election protocols like LEACH in dynamic, remote wireless networks (WSNs). SACHE enhances cluster formation through a neighborhood-aware CH election process, reducing communication overhead and improving energy efficiency and network stability. It is specifically adapted for dynamic topologies and node mobility, making it suitable for environments where static assumptions are inadequate. Key features include: (1) a dynamic, neighborhood-based CH election mechanism for stable clusters; (2) a method to mitigate muted rounds, ensuring continuous communication; and (3) an adaptive, self-regulating algorithm with a hyperparameter to stabilize CH assignments over time. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics—the Dynamic Load Balancing Index (DLBI) and Relative Silence Period Index (RSPI)—to assess load distribution across CHs and muted round minimization, providing a deeper evaluation of protocol effectiveness. Our theoretical contributions include the Dynamic Equilibrium Election Theorem, which explains how to maintain balanced CH assignments, extending network life and ensuring stable communication. 
Through simulations, we show that SACHE performs better than current protocols like LEACH, SEP, and LEACH Centralized, especially in energy savings, load balance, fewer muted rounds, and overall network performance across different scenarios. This makes SACHE a strong choice for applications needing reliable, energy-efficient networks, such as emergency response and real-time monitoring systems.
